    "When you executed the previous cell the string \"M.set_center(-74, 43, 6)\" was transmitted over a web socket to the webserver,  then proxied through ZeroMQ to the IPykernel where it was evaluated as a Python expression. This is the standard way in which Jupyter notebook takes code from a web browser,  and executes it in an interactive shell (kernel). M is an object in the kernel,  and it has a function *set_center*.  That function executed and returned a [promise](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/promise),  which is why you see something in the cell output like ```<promise.promise.Promise at 0x7f567dd8f290>```\n",
    "\n",
    "While the ```set_center``` function returns a promise,  it also has a side effect. This side effect uses a custom jupyter communication channel (or 'Comm') to tell the map to change its view port so the center is at (in this case) -74.0 latitude,  43.0 longitude,  with a zoom level of 6. \n",
